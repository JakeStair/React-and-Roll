## About the Project
This project is a responsive portfolio site built with React to showcase my work in videography, design, and development. The goal is to create a dynamic and visually cohesive portfolio, emphasizing a mobile-first design with customized Bootstrap styling.

## Technologies Used
- **React** – For building reusable UI components and managing the front-end logic
- **React Router** – For client-side navigation within the app
- **Bootstrap** – To streamline styling and layout with responsive design principles
- **CSS Modules** – For styling components with a modular approach

## Features
- **Responsive Design** – Designed with a mobile-first approach to ensure compatibility on all devices.
- **Customizable Navigation Bar** – Includes links aligned to the right with my name/logo on the left.
- **Cohesive Styling** – Consistent color schemes and typography across the site for a professional look.
- **Dynamic Components** – Built using `Header`, `Footer`, and `Navigation` components, with reusable styles.
